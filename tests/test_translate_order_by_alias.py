"""ORDER BY referencing a RETURN projection alias.

Cypher allows ``RETURN size(r.roles) AS n ORDER BY n``, but AQL's ``SORT`` runs
before the ``RETURN`` that binds ``n``, so emitting ``SORT n`` makes AQL read
``n`` as a collection ("collection or view not found: n"). The alias is inlined
to its compiled expression instead (``SORT LENGTH(r.roles)``), referencing the
still-live FOR variables.
