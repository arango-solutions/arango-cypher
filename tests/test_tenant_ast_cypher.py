"""Wave 8a MT-3a — contract tests for the core Cypher AST rewriter.

These tests pin the algorithmic seam between MT-3a (this PR — visitor
skeleton, property-map injection, WHERE / UNWIND literal rejection)
and MT-3b (traversal-path promotion) / MT-3c (route + UI wiring):

* Every TENANT_ROOT and TENANT_SCOPED-with-denorm node pattern gets the
  bind-variable predicate injected into its property map, with
  deterministic key ordering (alphabetical existing keys, tenant
  field last).
* Every literal tenant value — in a property map, in a WHERE
  equality, or inside an ``UNWIND [...]`` list literal — is refused.
* Every TENANT_SCOPED-without-denorm (traversal-only) node pattern
  raises :class:`TenantScopeRewriteIncomplete` so MT-3c can fall back
  to Layer 5 enforcement until MT-3b lands.
* Every unknown label is refused (fail-closed).
* GLOBAL entities are untouched — the rewriter returns the original
  Cypher byte-for-byte.

Test fixtures intentionally use the *narrowest* manifest required for
each case (rather than a fat shared manifest) so a test failure
points cleanly at the missing entity entry. The
``_build_manifest`` helper accepts an explicit ``known_tenant_keys``
set so we can exercise both the populated-keyset path and the
fail-closed (``None``) path of
:func:`tenant_ast_common.is_literal_tenant_value`.
