"""Layer 5 — EXPLAIN-plan tenant-scope validator (the security boundary).

This module implements the safety boundary defined by
``docs/multitenant_prd.md`` §1.2 / §8 and ``docs/agent_prompts_multitenant.md``
Wave 7 part 3:

  A query is *safe* if, for every collection it reads, one of these
  holds:
    1. The collection's physical layout kind is ``satellite``.
    2. The collection's physical layout kind is ``smartgraph`` AND the
       plan's access node carries a bind-var-based filter / index
       predicate of the form ``doc.<smartGraphAttribute> == @tenantId``
       whose ``@tenantId`` value equals the session's tenant id.
    3. The collection is ``Tenant`` (TENANT_ROOT) AND the access is
       keyed by ``@tenantKey`` (the session tenant's ``_key``).
    4. The access occurs inside a subquery or traversal whose
       enclosing constraint already guarantees the per-document
       tenant id matches ``@tenantId``.

``validate_plan`` calls ArangoDB ``EXPLAIN`` once per query and walks
the resulting plan, refusing anything that does not satisfy the above
**regardless of which upstream layer produced the AQL**. It trusts no
LLM, no guardrail, no AST pass, no transpiler — if Layer 5 passes, the
query is safe; if it refuses, the query does not execute.

This is the security boundary. Every refusal emits a structured
``TENANT_SCOPE_VIOLATION`` audit log line with both the AQL and plan
digests; every pass emits a ``TENANT_SCOPE_OK`` line with the same
digests. Both are required for audit replay — do not silence the OK
line for performance.

Wired through :func:`arango_query_core.exec.safe_execute` (Wave 7
part 4), which spreads ``{tenantId, tenantKey}`` from the session
over the client-supplied bind vars **last** so the session value
silently wins.

Layer 5 is independent of Wave 8a's Layers 3 / 4 (AST rewrites). The
predicates Layer 3 / 4 inject (``doc.<field> == @tenantId``) are the
shapes Layer 5 recognises here.

Bind-resolution sentinel (real-ArangoDB EXPLAIN)
------------------------------------------------
ArangoDB's EXPLAIN **resolves value bind parameters into literal
``value`` nodes** in the returned plan — a ``@tenantId`` reference
becomes ``{"type": "value", "value": "<the tenant id>"}``, and the
optimiser frequently fuses the injected ``FILTER`` *into* the
``EnumerateCollectionNode`` (``node["filter"]``) rather than leaving a
standalone ``CalculationNode``. A naïve "only accept a ``parameter``
node named tenantId" check therefore fails on every real query, while
a "accept any literal on the tenant field" check would re-open the T2
literal-smuggling hole (a caller could hard-code another tenant's id).

To get both safety and real-DB compatibility, :func:`validate_plan`
EXPLAINs with a fresh, unguessable **sentinel** substituted for
``tenantId`` (``bind_vars`` for execution are untouched). The plan
walker then accepts a tenant-field equality only when it compares
against (a) a ``parameter`` named ``tenantId`` — the hand-crafted /
``plan_override`` shape used by tests and any ArangoDB build that does
not fold the bind — or (b) a ``value`` literal **equal to the
per-call sentinel**. Because the sentinel is random per validation, a
caller cannot smuggle a matching literal, so a literal that is *not*
the sentinel is still refused as ``LITERAL_TENANT_PREDICATE``. The
walker also descends through ``AND`` conjunctions (never ``OR``) and
inspects the inline ``EnumerateCollectionNode.filter`` so a fused
predicate is recognised.

# MT-6 — plan-shape certification LRU (Layer 5 performance)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# The EXPLAIN round-trip + plan walk is the dominant cost of Layer 5
# (PRD §9: "One EXPLAIN round-trip per execute. Typical: 5–20 ms.").
# It is amortisable because the structural pass/fail decision depends
# ONLY on the query text and the schema — NOT on the tenant's bind-var
# *value*: :func:`validate_plan` EXPLAINs with a random per-call
# sentinel substituted for ``@tenantId``, so the resulting plan shape
# (and therefore whether the walk accepts it) is identical for every
# session running the same AQL against the same schema. We can thus
# cache "this (aql, schema) shape is structurally safe" and reuse it
# across sessions and across bind-var values.
#
# Safety invariants (why this cannot leak):
#   * The cache key fingerprints the AQL text **and** the full schema
#     inputs the walker reads (manifest roles / denorm fields /
#     tenant_entity, sharding profile, collection→entity map). Any
#     schema change yields a different key — a stale certification is
#     never consulted (PRD §9: "TTL bounded by mapping fingerprint so a
#     schema change invalidates certifications").
#   * Only structural PASSes are cached. Violations and transient
#     EXPLAIN failures are never cached (a transient DB error must not
#     poison the shape; a real violation is cheap to re-derive).
#   * The per-call bind-var checks (session has a tenant; a present
#     ``@tenantId`` bind equals the session tenant) ALWAYS run, even on
#     a cache hit — the cache only skips the EXPLAIN + structural walk,
#     never the session-identity gate.
#   * Every pass is still logged (with the certified plan digest and a
#     ``cache=hit`` marker) so the audit trail from PRD §9 is intact.
#
# The cache is thread-safe (FastAPI runs sync routes on a threadpool)
# and bounded (LRU eviction). ``TENANT_PLAN_CACHE_SIZE=0`` disables it.

    MT-7 — admin cross-tenant bypass. When ``admin_bypass`` is set AND
    the session is flagged ``is_admin`` AND a non-empty ``bypass_reason``
    is supplied, the tenant-scope enforcement (the bind-var identity gate
    and the per-node tenant-predicate walk) is skipped so an operator may
    legitimately span tenants (PRD §10). The **structural** checks are
    NOT bypassed — the query is still EXPLAINed and a failed / malformed
    plan is still refused. Every honoured bypass emits an
    ``ADMIN_CROSS_TENANT_BYPASS`` line to the dedicated
    ``arango_cypher.tenant_audit`` stream with the reason and digests. A
    bypass requested without admin rights or without a reason is ignored
    (falls through to normal enforcement) — defence in depth behind the
    route's own gate. The plan-shape cache is skipped for bypass calls
    (they never run the structural walk, so must not populate or read the
    certification LRU).

    Algorithm (PRD §8.2):

    1. Fetch ``plan = db.aql.explain(aql, bind_vars=bind_vars)["plan"]``.
       (When ``plan_override`` is supplied — used by unit tests — skip
       the round-trip and use it directly. The override path is only
       activated when explicitly passed; it never substitutes for a
       missing ``db`` in production.)
    2. Walk the plan nodes and classify each into ``satellite``,
       ``tenant_root`` (Tenant collection), ``tenant_scoped``, or
       ``unknown``. If any node is ``tenant_scoped`` (i.e. the plan
       reads a smartgraph collection or a manifest-tagged
       ``TENANT_SCOPED`` entity), the query is *tenant-touching* and
       the bind-var sanity check must pass:

       * ``session.tenant_id`` must not be ``None``.
       * **If** ``bind_vars`` carries a ``tenantId``, it must equal
         ``session.tenant_id``. When ``tenantId`` is absent (the AQL
         never references ``@tenantId`` — e.g. an unconstrained scan, or
         a storage-isolated disjoint-smartgraph traversal) the precise
         per-node walk below decides: it refuses an unconstrained scan
         with ``UNCONSTRAINED_COLLECTION_SCAN`` and accepts a disjoint
         smartgraph. Layer 6 (``safe_execute``) only injects the
         ``@tenantId`` bind when the query references it, so ``tenantId``
         being present here already implies it equals the session value
         — the equality check is retained as defence in depth.

       If the plan touches **only** satellite / global / Tenant-by-key
       collections, the bind-var check is **not** required — pure
       reference-data queries (e.g. ``FOR c IN Country RETURN c``)
       remain executable without a tenant binding.

    3. Per node type, refuse anything not covered by §1.2 (see helpers
       below).

    4. Emit a structured audit log line (pass *and* refuse).
