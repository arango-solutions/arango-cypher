#     summary surfaces in `metadata.reconciliation` (consumed above in
#     `acquire_mapping_bundle` to emit a warning when backfilling occurred).
#
# The golden-diff gate (`scripts/pr3_workaround_diff.py`) confirmed that
# upstream output is byte-identical with vs. without these post-processors
# across every fixture DB (movies_pg, movies_lpg, cypher_{pg,lpg,hybrid},

    - A *full* fingerprint (shape + row counts). When it matches, cached
      cardinality statistics are reused too; when only it differs,
      statistics are recomputed on top of the cached mapping (the
      "stats-only refresh" fast path).

    Caches are layered:

    1. Process-local ``dict`` for same-session hits.
    2. Optional persistent ArangoDB collection (``cache_collection``) for
       cross-restart and cross-instance sharing. Pass ``cache_collection=None``
