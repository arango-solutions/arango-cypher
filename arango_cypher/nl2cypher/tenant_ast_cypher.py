"""Wave 8a MT-3a — Cypher AST tenant-injection (core).

This module is the **first phase** of the Layer 3 rewriter described in
``docs/multitenant_prd.md`` §6. MT-3 was sliced into three phases so each
phase fits in a single sub-agent run; the boundaries are:

* **MT-3a (this module)** — visitor skeleton + property-map injection
  for the *easy* cases. Handles TENANT_ROOT (``_key: $tenantKey``),
  TENANT_SCOPED with a denorm field, GLOBAL pass-through, literal
  rejection in property maps / WHERE / UNWIND, and the unknown-label
  REFUSE path. Traversal-only TENANT_SCOPED entities raise
  :class:`TenantScopeRewriteIncomplete`.
* **MT-3b** — traversal-path promotion for TENANT_SCOPED entities that
  have no denorm field (the
  ``(:Tenant {_key: $tenantKey})-[:R]->...->(e:Employee)`` rewrite from
  PRD §6.3, last example). MT-3b consumes the
  :class:`TenantScopeRewriteIncomplete` signal that MT-3a raises and
  catches the case here.
* **MT-3c** — route + UI wiring. Calls :func:`inject_tenant_scope` from
  ``arango_cypher/service/routes/cypher.py`` and surfaces the changes
  list as ``tenantRewrites`` on the translate-response, rendered in the
  Cypher editor's annotation strip.

Why a phased rollout
--------------------
The full Layer 3 spec (visitor + path-promotion + dedup + route + UI)
is ~400 LOC plus 20 tests. A single sub-agent run that touches a new
AST module, a service route, a response model, a UI panel, and
introduces 20+ goldens routinely blows the run's budget — Wave 8a's
prior attempts under ``feat/wave8a-mt3-cypher-ast-tenant-injection``
and ``-retry`` both stranded mid-implementation. Splitting at the
*algorithmic seam* (denorm-field path vs. traversal-path) keeps each
slice deployable in isolation and lets Layer 5 catch any
TENANT_SCOPED collection that MT-3a refuses to rewrite (it raises
``TenantScopeRewriteIncomplete``; the caller falls back to the
pre-rewrite Cypher and Layer 5's plan validator then enforces the
guard at execute time).

Design notes
------------
* **No external visitor base class.** The codebase had a recent cleanup
  that removed the generated ``CypherVisitor`` (only ``CypherLexer`` and
  ``CypherParser`` remain under ``arango_cypher/_antlr/``). Subclassing
  ``ParseTreeVisitor`` would require us to dispatch ``visitOC_*``
  manually anyway because the parser contexts call
  ``visitor.visitOC_NodePattern(self)`` only when the visitor defines
  that method — there is no auto-generated walker. We instead do a
  small recursive ``getRuleIndex`` switch (see :func:`_walk_rule`)
  that's easier to read for the three rules we care about and avoids
  pulling in code we'd otherwise need to regenerate from grammar
  changes.

* **Text edits keyed by char offset.** ANTLR4's
  ``ParserRuleContext.getText()`` is byte-faithful for unmodified
  subtrees because the Cypher grammar puts ``SP`` (whitespace) on the
  default channel — every whitespace token is consumed by some rule
  and therefore appears in ``getText()``. For *modified* node
  patterns we re-render the property map manually (alphabetical
  existing keys, tenant key last) and splice the new text in via
  reverse-offset string edits on the original Cypher source. This
  keeps the unchanged spans byte-identical without needing the
  ``TokenStreamRewriter`` (which would require the
  ``BufferedTokenStream`` we don't currently expose from
  :func:`arango_cypher.parser.parse_cypher`).

* **Rejection codes mirror Layer 5.** :class:`TenantScopeRewriteRejection`
  carries a short ``code`` string that matches the codes Layer 5 emits
  (see ``arango_cypher/tenant_plan_validator.py``:
  ``LITERAL_TENANT_PREDICATE``, ``UNKNOWN_ENTITY``). MT-3c will surface
  the same codes via the response model so the UI's error path
  doesn't have to know whether a refusal came from Layer 3, Layer 4,
  or Layer 5.

PRD source-of-truth
-------------------
* ``docs/multitenant_prd.md`` §6.1 / §6.2 / §6.3 / §6.5.
* ``docs/agent_prompts_multitenant.md`` MT-3 section (Wave 8a).
* :func:`arango_cypher.nl2cypher.tenant_ast_common.predicate_for_entity`
  is the single source of truth for "what predicate shape is needed
  for this label" — we never reinvent the role/denorm-field decision
  tree here.

    """The rewriter refuses to scope the query.

    Carries a short ``code`` string that matches the codes emitted by
    Layer 5 (``arango_cypher/tenant_plan_validator.py``) so the route
    layer (MT-3c) can render a single error UX regardless of which
    layer raised. The ``where`` field is a free-form locator (e.g.
    ``"(e:Employee)"`` or ``"WHERE e.TENANT_HEX_ID = 'tenant-B-uuid'"``)
    surfaced into the user-facing error message.

    Codes used by MT-3a
    -------------------
    * ``LITERAL_TENANT_PREDICATE`` — a property-map / WHERE / UNWIND
      literal carries a tenant identifier. The session bind variable
      is the only legitimate channel for tenant identity (PRD §6.2,
      §5.2).
    * ``UNKNOWN_ENTITY`` — a node pattern references a label that the
      manifest does not classify. Fail-closed: we cannot tell whether
      the label is tenant-scoped without an entry in the manifest.

    Codes reserved for MT-3b / MT-3c
    --------------------------------
    Future phases may add codes for traversal-path collisions and
    multi-tenant join refusal. They must keep the same dataclass
    shape so the response model in MT-3c does not have to special-case
    them.

    pattern with a path from the ``Tenant`` root — that logic is
    deferred to MT-3b.

    For now, the caller (route layer in MT-3c) is expected to:

    1. Catch this exception.

    Parameters
    ----------
    cypher:
        The original Cypher source text. Used as the source of truth
        for byte offsets when splicing in the new property maps.
    parse_tree:
        The ANTLR4 parse tree produced by
        :func:`arango_cypher.parser.parse_cypher`. Must correspond to
        ``cypher`` (same input string); MT-3a does not re-parse.
    manifest:
        Tenant-scope manifest built by
        :func:`arango_cypher.nl2cypher.tenant_scope.analyze_tenant_scope`.
        Drives the per-label scope decision via
        :func:`predicate_for_entity`.
    tenant_id:
        Bound to ``@tenantId``; only used when MT-3c renders the
        response (MT-3a never embeds the value literally — every
        rewrite uses the bind variable ``$tenantId``).
    tenant_key:
        Bound to ``@tenantKey``; same caveat as ``tenant_id``.

    Returns
    -------
    rewritten_cypher, changes:
        ``rewritten_cypher`` is the modified text; identical to
        ``cypher`` when no rewrites were necessary (all labels GLOBAL).
        ``changes`` is a list of human-readable descriptions, one per
        injection, intended for MT-3c's UI annotation strip.

    Raises
    ------
    TenantScopeRewriteRejection
        On a literal tenant predicate (T2 defence), an unknown label,
        or a literal-tenant key inside an UNWIND list.
    TenantScopeRewriteIncomplete
