"""Tenant-scoping postcondition for NL → Cypher / AQL translation.

When the mapping bundle declares a ``Tenant`` entity and the caller
supplies an active :class:`TenantContext`, the emitted Cypher MUST be
scoped to that tenant. Otherwise the query silently escapes tenant
isolation and returns cross-tenant rows — a data-leak-class bug in a
multi-tenant graph, not a translation-quality nit.

What "scoped" means is **manifest-driven**, not hardcoded:

* If the query touches a tenant-scoped entity that carries a
  denormalised tenant field (e.g. ``Device.TENANT_ID``), filtering on
  that field with the active tenant value is sufficient — no
  ``:Tenant`` binding required, because the planner can satisfy the
  scope with an indexed equality on the column.
* If the query touches a tenant-scoped entity that has no denorm
  field, the only way to scope it is via traversal from a
  ``:Tenant`` node, and the guardrail enforces that.
* If the query touches **only** GLOBAL entities (e.g. ``Cve``,
  ``AppVersion``), the guardrail does not fire — those collections are
  intentionally cross-tenant reference data and forcing a
  ``:Tenant`` binding would refuse legitimate questions like "list
  all CVEs".

The classification of which entity is which comes from
:func:`arango_cypher.nl2cypher.tenant_scope.analyze_tenant_scope` —
keeping that knowledge in a separate module means we can replace the
heuristic with the upstream schema analyzer's first-class
``tenantScope`` annotation without churning this file.

The guardrail is invoked inside
:func:`arango_cypher.nl2cypher.nl_to_cypher` after every LLM emission.
A violation is fed back into the retry loop so the model can correct
itself; if the retry budget is exhausted the caller receives an
empty-Cypher result with an explanation — the translator
**fails closed**, never silently returning a cross-tenant query.

Back-compat note
----------------
``prompt_section`` and ``check_tenant_scope`` both accept a manifest
optionally. Callers that don't pass one fall through to the v1
behaviour (force a ``:Tenant`` binding, hardcoded ``TENANT_ID`` hint
in the prompt). New code should always pass a manifest — the
fallback exists only to keep the public API stable for downstream
consumers who haven't migrated yet.
